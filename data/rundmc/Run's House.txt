RUN DMC LYRICS




"Run's House"



[Run]
A whole lot of superstars, on this stage here tonight
But I want you all to know one thing-this is....
[DMC] My...
[Run] House and when I say who's house, you all know what time it is.
Who's house?
Run's house!

[Run]
Ah, once again my friend
Not a trend for then
They said, rap was crap
But never had this band
Till the ruler came
With a cooler name
Made ya dance and prance and draw the fans insane
Name is Run my son
Number one for fun
Not a gun that's done and get done by none
The others act, in fact, is just wack I kill
[DMC] Why?
[Run] It's fun my son and Run heads the bill!

[Chorus]
Who's house?
Run's house!
[repeat twice]

[DMC]
I'm in the house you all
I'm in the house yall
And this is how Run DMC will turn it out yall
I'm in the house yall
I'm in the house yall
And this is what run DMC be about yall
Will my name is DMC,
The all-time great
I bust the most rhymes in New York state
Reporters Claw
Producers die
They want to be down with the king!
The wanted man from the wanted clan
Wanted by every fan from across the land
Not a G.A.N.G from off the street
R. and U.N. D.M.C complete!

[Chorus]

[DMC] get on the mic and (emcee)
[Run]
Another time I take
For the rhyme I make
Make me mad and sad because the fad is fake
See I do this thing so come presue this king
One mind I rhyme so all you just bring
Cus I'm the best I'm def
Ask the rest they left
That's my name my game and we don't need the rep
So keep the booze you loose and suckas cool your mouth
I set a trap for rap thats crap
It's Run's house!

[Chorus]

[DMC]
Some underestimate
And miscalculate
My intent to create what I call the great
Till I make a song that I prove em wrong
See my song so strong it'll make 'em come along
Come in the door
Get on the floor
Hard rock hard hitting hip-hop hard-core
Causing casualties and catastrophes
And tragedies for the suck emcees
Use a strategy to get the best of me
You dirty rat emcees
Whoever you may be
You need to go down south
You need to shut your mouth
It's all about no doubt just shout cus we turn it out!

[Chorus]
