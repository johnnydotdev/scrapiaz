RUN DMC LYRICS




"It's Over"
(feat. Jermaine Dupri)



[Jermaine Dupri]
uh huh

ah hah 
ah hah

see when y'all heard that 
all I'm doin is laughin' at all y'all niggers that been frontin' 
on my man's in there man, these niggers started this shit man

[Run]
When I come to the show that I rock 
and the flow that I drop 
y'all know Run kills the mic 
can't forget about the olds that I got 
and the rolls in the spot 
ya'll know I'm still the right 
how ya gonna take an old song been around so long 
so so def the name is tight 
done went from a DJ to an MC to the REV like overnight 
everybody lookin' players get shook when 
Rev Run walk up in the spot 
even though the crooks that 
be livin' up out in Brooklyn 
just can't help but point and laugh 
everywhere I go now 
people say "oh wow" 
cause they know how I get 
It don't matter if it's motown 
all the way to your town 
you can't slow down my game

[Jermaine Dupri]
can't slow it down man 
think about this 
from 1983 to 2000, its 2001 
and these niggas are still on the run 
y'all niggas just crazy 
ya'll out here tryin' to front 
like __nigga went and bought a pair of shell toes 
the f*ck is wrong with y'all

[Run]
People wanna hear Rev Run say 
cuz I got dough that I must be a type of fraud 
but you know that the thing that's funny 
this garden ain't money, how rich is the lawn 
went and got JD , made me crazy play me up in the club 
got a brand new mercedes for my lady 
bustin me I'm older 
to a Bentley and all that come out the garage 
on the side of a grand prestigious home 
Y'all ask if I'm  blessed, 
by God player what you thought, what Rev do you see on 
gotta make these dollars, comin outta Hollis 
got my collar on two, I got the rhyme on the beat 
and the vibe in the street and now the rest is on you

[Jermaine Dupri]
the rest is on me man 
let me let j'all know somethin' 
the first rap group to get on MTV 
heard heavy ya heard me 
and then they go turn around and resurrect Aerosmith like 
you know what I mean, there ain't none of that, 
know what I'm sayin 
and if it weren't for these cats man y'all wouldn't know  
nothin' about no LL Cool J or Beastie Boys you know what I mean 
and this comin' from me I'm lookin at it man 
since I've been 13 years old, now I been watchin these cats man 
I aint no old nigga, but I know nigga ya heard me 
ya know what I'm sayin', so stop all that frontin' man 
stop all your frontin' ya heard me 
ya hear

[Run]
We get the hits that I made on the gig that I played 
if ya had love back in the day 
just raised up my kicks and changed the spit 
and returned the Run y'all love today 
I picked the mic back up, came right back up  
to the top where I'm supposed to be [JD:] (supposed to be) 
and when the track light up y'all come back right up 
y'all playa's too close to me

[Jermaine Dupri]
You know what I used to like? 
the way my man used to come up on stage 
and grab the mic or just throw the damn stand  
across the stage man 
then he used to tell his man like  
"Yo D, come right here in the middle of the stage, 
grab yo dick and say what you gotta say" 
and you know what D used to say 
he used to say 
"Party people, your dreams have now  
been fullfilled, get out your seats and let's get ill 
that's right y'all, we not just rough, we more than tough" 
and when it comes to shit like this hah we got enough 
know what I mean? you know who the f*ck I am 
you know my name, you know my game 
its So So Def, Run DMC
