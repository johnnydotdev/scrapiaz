RUN DMC LYRICS




"Take The Money And Run"
(feat. Everlast)



[Run] 
Let me tell you about what I love with Gina 
Lover like no other couldn't get in between her 
Always stayed fly man, I'm wishing to seen her 
Said they had a scheme, but nobody believed her 
No real job cause she stay in the street 
Gina didn't nail but the love made beats 
When they want to eat, they just walked in the store 
They took what they wanted man they the illest you saw 
So one day they went uptown and seen em' with ice 
Butter liked to change and Gina said they're breaking ice 
Next thing you know they wan to pull of the heights 
Shook to the look and shoot the tulip twice 
Down with old Sherman as they flew in the air 
Butter acting rough and Ram was struck by the pair 
Gina had the door cause she goofed with the gun 
They both grabbed the money and run

[Chorus]
Come on take the money and run (run) 
Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey 
Come on take the money and run 
Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey

Smoothie was a rookie that was doing a scene 
Used to be a dog, now he's doing it clean 
Ironic he was cupping and they gave him the spot 
Now Butter buffing Hollis used to chill in the park 
Said run around they way with a brand new band 
Gina looking pretty in the city of frame 
Smoothie said y'all got to get these in 
And these are the two I've got to act enhanced 
And these were from Hollis promised not to tell 
And leave these cocks from a long, long trail 
Smoothie saw Gina and a chick turned pale 
Ronnie saying something like she know got bailed 
Butter said promise me I won't see jail 
Smoothie won a watch in a brand new cell 
Butter and Gina moved to Pepsi cola 
Smoothie got a rollie and I'm on the roller

[Chorus]
Come on take the money and run (run) 
Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey 
Come on take the money and run, that's what I say 
Come on take the money and run, yeah yeah yeah

All I can say is about the story 
And living like Butter love is not floury 
Let me show you how we get the money legit 
Jack B. Nimble was nimble and he was quick 
Well Run-DMC is the kings of rock 
Rolled to the top and then we never get dropped 
You still have us chilling in 2001 
And me and D will take the money and run

[Chorus]
Come on take the money and run (run) 
Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey 
Come on take the money and run, that's what I say 
Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey 
Come on take the money and run, that's what I say 
Come on take the money and run, yeah yeah yeah 
Come on take the money and run, aha 
Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey 
Hey hey hey 
That's what I say
