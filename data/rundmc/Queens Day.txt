RUN DMC LYRICS




"Queens Day"
(feat. Nas & Prodigy of Mobb Deep)



[Nas:] With the Kings of rock now, nigga 
Know what I mean?

[DMC:] Queens day cash made on Hollis Ave. 
Queen's Queen's Queen's 
yea yea   yea, make, make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day cash made on Hollis Ave. 
Q-B-O-R-O nigga

Yo, from the days of encore 
Niggers hung around blocks and corner stores 
Huggin' gold chains of fantasies rushing the door 
Niggers from Rochdale, poppin' shells snatching rings 
Fly from sure kings from Queens press the one-eighteen 
I have my eyes open stepping out into the world 
So fiendish, Old English till I earl, growing pains 
a young kid learning early how to know the game 
USA roller-skate ring, marks the crews with techniques 
Clean streets, hustlers, crack, cocaine 
Getting back by throwing block parties and basketball games 
A lot of cash made on Hollis Ave 
Fast to change, high rollers was living, 
Until the taskforce came 
A lot of ghost-towns and memories, bad-blooded enemies 
So many die with the same gangster pride that entered me 
These are the old-timers, they who taught us 
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters 
With your flow, and I'm proud to be all that I know 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga who I'd die for, survive war 
How we came a long way in solidarity 
Don't let nothing try to spoil this day 
To Run, D and Jay is love and my thugs salute 
Cause real love is the only thing that comes above this loot 
Carhard jeans that makes me think of LL's troops 
Let's celebrate it's Queens day this one's for you

Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Queens, Queens....

Some come out of their hometown and they never get dough 
But three teens from Queens take over the world and never let go 
Just regular cats you know, that just happened to blow 
Not synonymous with Hollis Jay, Darryl and Joe 
Ayo we made it so that others can grow 
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest , mam and Nas let's go 
Ain't taking credit be showing pride look at us now 
Got haters mouths all opened wide wondering how 
In some cases the only thing that father and son 
Have in common, is their love for Run 
Been the illest since day one, too advanced to ever be caught 
Who's more legendary than me? That's what I thought 
And if somebody want to test mine, yo watch this: 
Peter Piper picked pepper: 
See, I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it 
Just spend a minute, I'm still the king of the world 
So don't forget it:

Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga, who I die for

[This verse needs some work]
This is for my Q dogs, who lit a block's bright spark 
We grew up on Old English, summertime Roy with this park 
used to be the shit While they had to stop 
on the Ave niggas looting all the jewelry spots 
Kicked the shirt kegs for ewe everybody stopped 
Let it match my cork tests nights 
Niggas getting raw, get the back door 
Coming out with bags, we used to get our go fronts 
From Eddy's gold caps, whatcha know about that 
I bet the whole Queens go around 86th with the Chrome bash crew 
The young guns and laws voice made the new scream 
Create Death story two 
The story is true, so let's party for the furor we say 
And everybody come outside, cause it's Queens day kid

Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy 
Queens day 
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga 
make it, make it seem easy
