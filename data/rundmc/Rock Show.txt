RUN DMC LYRICS




"Rock Show"
(feat. Stephan Jenkins of Third Eye Blind)



Jump... 
Dee... 
Jay... 
Run... 
DMC...

Yeah...! 
What...? 
Who...? 
King...of...Rock...!

I want to rock right now 
DJ Run, and I'm claiming my crown 
I be internationally known 
Even got chrome on my microphone

I ain't stoopid y'all, outrageous 
Actin like Run can't rock all ages 
So...Joe - act like y'all don't know 
Run be rockin since Kurtis Blow

Me and my brother be gettin this dough 
Came in the door, said it befoe' 
These are the Kings from around the way 
Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay...

[Chorus:]

I'm the King (what's up?) of ROCK! 
Who am I? 
I'm the King (of what?) of ROCK! 
WHO ARE WE? 
I'm the King (alright, never let ya down) of ROCK! 
In the end it's just a rock song 
I'm the King (alright, alright, alright) of ROCK! 
In the end it's just a rock song

Y'all wanna know what it takes to be 
An MC like D in the place to be 
Gotta a house on the hill full of family 
With the grass more green than a gram of weed

Stars in the cars on the way to my Show 
Gettin raw at the pub when they're drinking the mo 
With a cigar and the pumps he be getting the dough 
And unchanged with the lane and the range of the roll

Just 'cause y'all know my name 
Heard my fame and seen my game 
Don't mean I'm all about the glitter and glam 
The King of Rock - is who I am

Raw - we are - by law 
First one rockin' in Adidas y'all saw 
Jumped on Tour way back in '84 
Jay, Run, D, Macs rock-knockin' at your door

[Chorus:]

I'm the King (alright, never let ya down) of ROCK! 
In the end it's just a rock song 
I'm the King (alright, never let ya down) of ROCK! 
Cause in the end it's just a rock song 
I'm the King (alright, never let ya go) of ROCK! 
cause in the end it's just a rock song 
I'm the King (alright, alright, alright) of ROCK! 
In the end it's just a rock song 
Who am I? 
I'm the King (alright, alright, alright/of what?) of ROCK! 
In the end it's just a rock song
