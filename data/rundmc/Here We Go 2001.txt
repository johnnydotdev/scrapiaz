"Here We Go 2001"
(feat. Sugar Ray)



[DMC] 
Check this out 
One, two three, in the place to be

[Run] 
And this is sugar Ray and Run DMC, here we go 
DMC and DJ Run Dum diddi dum diddi diddi dum dum 
We're rocking on the mic and then you know where we're from 
Dum diddi dum diddi diddi dum dum 
We hope y'all ready for the big beat drum 
Drum diddi dum diddi diddi drum drum 
So people in the place hear the big beat drum 
Here he come, here he come, here he kitty come come

Cool chief rocker, don't drink further 
Used to keep chiffon inside my locker 
Used to get toed down, now I slow down 
Hold the flow down from mo town to yo town 
I be the MC the ripper knight lead 
They said to me, luck it might be slightly 
But if it's luck, then I'm the luckiest you know 
I'm running this keep on rock yo, here we go

And the history of the soul 
And this be going on and on 
Since the days of rock n' roll 
Purple hair hip hop and soul, here we go 
Here we go yeah, here we go now 
Yeah, DJ Run:

[Run-DMC] 
Rhymes so def, rhymes rhymes galore 
Rhymes that you've never even heard before 
Say you've heard my rhymes, we're gonna have to fight 
Cause I just made the hot shut up last night 
That's right I'm rhyming tight to catch on the block 
Took it to new heights look at Kid Rock y'all 
I eat the rock crock, to put y'all on 
To have a Limp Bizkit in a piece of corn

[DMC and DJ run]
Dum diddi dum diddi diddi dum dum 
We're rocking on the mic and then you know where we're from 
Dum diddi dum diddi diddi dum dum 
We hope y'all ready for the big beat drum 
Drum diddi drum diddi diddi drum drum 
So people in the place hear the big beat drum 
Here he come, here he come, here he kitty come come

Devastated mic controller 
The word wizard and the chief rock puller 
Bad beat boy made for the beat girls 
Rock through the rhymes as the turntable swirls 
Supreme people who was born to talk 
And over any recorded rap king we'll mix all 
These are the kings from around the way: 
Run, DMC, and Jam Master Jay

And the history of the soul 
And this be going on and on 
Since the days of rock n' roll 
Purple hair hip hop and soul, here we go 
Here we go yeah, here we go now 
Yeah, DJ Run:
