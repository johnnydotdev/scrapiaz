PUBLIC ENEMY LYRICS




"...And No One Broadcasted Louder Than... (Intro)"



[Show reporter]
I'm not going to lie and act like..
I have always thought.. all Hip-Hop or Rap was the world's greatest thing
But Public Enemy.. made me realized.. 
that all Rap is not the same
They made the world listen
They articulated the frustrations and anger
of the Black Community, more importantly; 
They changed the perception of what Hip-Hop could be
Chuck D said: that Rap was the CNN of the Black Community
And no one broadcasted louder.. than Public Enemy
