"Broke Diva"



Tried to boss me 
Tried to out outfloss me
I just don't need her
Broke diva

It ain't cheaper to keep her
Should I love her or leave her
I just don't need 
Another broke diva

See I work
She don't work
But shes first to curse
Whit sht don't work
I take my ass around the earth
So she can spend my money first
Ok?
I forgot how we became 2 people
A couple
Damn sure not financially equal
She lost me
When it started to cost me
Lost me
She tried to out floss me 

Yall should hear her
Always I the mirror
You should see her
Some of yall wish you can be her
Getting up in the afternoon
While the whole world 

2-3oclock
I been up and down the block 
Gotta tell this woman to bounce
Buying these designer tags she cant pronounce
With my bank account
Down and out
She ain't even got the nerve to keep count

Hard odd
Got
Jacked up credit cards

Exotic cars
With notes paid off
From my checks she wrote
I hope she know
I ain't no casino
I got a job and you gotta go
Don't get it twisted
If you trying to get famous 
For being famous I missed it
You still want me to kick out;
I just did baby
You out
