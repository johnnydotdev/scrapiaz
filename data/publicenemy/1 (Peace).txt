PUBLIC ENEMY LYRICS




"1 (Peace)"



So long ago 
The story go 
I testify
I occupy
All the battlin and wrastlin
On capitol hill
Now the pill got you ill
And yall digital
I dig the dig
Been offed the pig
Diggin the digital 
And I never renigged
Slow down 
They want a slower damn sound
Machine?
Who me
They don't even know what I mean
What I'm sayin
'what I'm seein
Is human beings
Who I'm seeing
What I'm saying
Who be playing
Whatim sayin
Seeing beings 
Humans turned into damn machines
They don't even know what the fk it means 
Yall can stop it on the 3
But they dropped it on the 1
The p e a c e just begun

Yes we can
Its out the can 
This mf beat is african
I rhyme once a while
When the sht is wild
Some people confused 
Consumin 
Style 
As you grab it
They come to grab us
Now they gots us 
I think they shot us
Corporations
Down to your bone
I ain't no dumb mf on a smart ass phone
I been legit
We never quit
Exploded 
Uploaded 
So yall can spit
Go on and downloaded
Mixtape
But it mixed
And it ain't tape
Don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin
Tweet for the joke of twitterin
My intuition 
Got me trippin
Position
Humans turned into damn machines
They don't even know what the fk I mean 
Yall can stop it on the 3
But they dropped it on the 1
The p e a c e just begun

My mind is mine
My grind design
I been that age 
They ain't been mine
So watch me work it
From my circuit
Against their purpose 
Of keepin truth from the youth 
A p.i .circus 
They tell yall speed 
Is what yall need
Make you consume
To get the boom
No answers 
No dancin
Y'all just consume
When the partys done 
They
Just tearin up the room 
Bomb the earth to pieces 
They cant calm the world to peace
The lease is up in this 
The belly of this beast
Humans turned into damn machines
They don't even know what the fk I mean 
Yall can stop it on the 3
But they dropped it on the 1
The p e a c e just begun
