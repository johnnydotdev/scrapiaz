PUBLIC ENEMY LYRICS




"Corplantationopoly"



(I bite the apple
And the apple bite me back)

Uh!
Corplantationopoly
Corplantationopoly

[Verse 1 - Chuck D:]
Bump bump bump bump bump bump bumpin
Music you love
Owned by something
Pity pity
Flock to these cities
Seem to forgot
Punch the robot
New ways replace the old daze
Know the old guys rule in disguise

Owning them masters
Corplantations
Making disasters

[Hook - Flavor Flav sample:]
To the beat y’all, you don’t stop
To the beat y’all, you don’t quit

[Verse 2 - Professor Griff:]
Manipulate thought
Bait and switch
Mind corp
Caught but never taught
Who owns the corp
Free the body
Arrest the spirit
Everybody’s looking around
Waiting for them to hear it
Capital court
Ad psyche
Soul is bought
Your soul just might be
Triggered by greed
That feeds the lust
They live for the
Pleasure
The high
The head rush

[Hook - Flavor Flav sample:]
To the beat y’all, you don’t stop
To the beat y’all, you don’t quit

[Verse 3 - Chuck D:]
Bump bump bump bump bump bump bumpin’

Bump bump bump bump bump bump bumpin’

Bump bump
How can I say this?

Here I go
Here go the black hippy
Cause they trippin’
C’mon get wit me

[Hook - Flavor Flav sample:]
To the beat y’all, you don’t stop
To the beat y’all, you don’t quit

[Verse 4 - Chuck D:]
Bump bump
How can I say this?
Corplantations spreading that matrix
Pity pity
Flock to these cities
Seem to forgot
Punch the robot
Made a livin’
Steal thanksgivin’
The law been givin’
Blood in my pocket
Can’t stop the corporate prophet
Out for just profit
Dare you to stop it

[Hook - Flavor Flav sample:]
To the beat y’all, you don’t stop
To the beat y’all, you don’t quit
