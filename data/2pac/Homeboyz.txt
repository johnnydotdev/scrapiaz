"Homeboyz"



[2Pac]
Oh s**t, caught that ni**a alone
Ain't that a bi**h
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh
for them ni**az that be Johnny Dangerous when they be f**kin fifty deep
But they be f**kin cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin about
(You know who I'm talkin about) that's right
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
You ain't s**t without your homeboys

Now
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
ni**a it's a god damn shame, somebody explain 
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that a*s out the frame, completely get that a*s kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, ni**a don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My s**t's cla*sic, like my ni**a Nate 
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
ni**az aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a f**k motherf**kers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't s**t without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a f**k, you ni**az is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary ni**az is punks, you ain't s**t without your homeboys
ni**a, punk a*s motherf**ker
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherf**ker

[Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the f**k you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac s**ttin ya box
You was lookin real weak walkin down the street
Now a ni**a thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a ni**a the fair one
Your homies like f**k it, what's this you the only scared one
(faggot a*s) Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw ni**a played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
ni**az be actin all different when they dogs come around
Watch em act like bi**hes when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned 
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy

[2Pac]
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
My thug ni**az, I love ni**az
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a ni**a got left
I love my ni**az to death, we ain't s**t without our homeboys
.. You know what time it is
I ain't s**t without my homeboys
Hey, tell em the story how you came up ni**a

Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw ni**a, I never die alone
Me and my ni**az is so close, it's complicated
One ni**a smokin and drinkin, and yet we all faded
My ni**a Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My ni**az cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherf**kers they all die
Been tryin to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, f**k 3D
You coward a*s motherf**kers'll never see me
Bustin with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
ni**az fiendin, I got em comin back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my ni**az be together

Ain't s**t without your homeboys
Thug ni**az I love ni**az
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a ni**a got left
I love my ni**az to death
We ain't s**t without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my ni**az to death
We ain't s**t without our homeboys
Love you ni**az to death
