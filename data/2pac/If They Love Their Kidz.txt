"If They Love Their Kidz"



If my enemies love their kids
only if my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
If my enemies love their kids
only if my enemies love their kids

Hey, why have drama
nigga, your baby mama stay right around the corner
I could touch her if I fucking wanna
so why you want insist on this
I got your name at the top of fucking dead bitch list
meet Mr Machiavelli’s terror
back of the year, thug of the era
death row and Outlawz, nobody does this shit better
my lyrics explode on contact
best prepare for combat
aint no stopping so bomb back
it’s the last days, nigga’s is dying for bullshit
Mac 11 is heavy, yeah I’m ready to pull quick
niggas aint ready for a brother thats living major
been waiting [?] muthafucker thats spittin’ razors,
when I cut em they cut, when I stick ‘em they stuck
my ambitions to bust, cause I aint giving a fuck
tore the neighbourhood up, look at all the shit that we did
murder’s a life long bitch
if my enemies love they kids

You don’t wanna die
and I don’t wanna kill ya,
keep my name out ya mouth
‘fore a nigga have to drill ya
all my enemies buggin’ for all the shit that they did
don’t make me murder you nigga
if my enemy’s love their kids

Body’s is wrapped in plastic
look at this, it’s drastic
takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static
like a mosberg jumpin, and muthafucker’s be jumpin’
play the role of a bitch
like Michael Jackson, wanna be startin’ something
holla at my crew and they perish you through the cherish
got the [?)]in my sight
tonight I’m bussin’ off the terrace with multiple gun shots
niggas be droppin’ rapidly, bussin’ clip to cops
and bitches running after me tellin I’m high
when they ask why I’m trippin’ out
top of my drop, cause you know why, keep dippin’ on my block
they sell rocks on box with frail cops
and then we buss shots from glocks, fuck cops
my only fear of death, can you hear me, it’s coming back
had enough of this bullshit world so none of that
I felt no remorse for all the shit that we did
niggas die at any time if my enemy’s love their kids

[Chorus]

You muthafucking right
you niggas better wise up
it’s a real muthafucking war nigga
you wanna get with me
how the fuck you gon get with me
if you got kids muthafucker
if my enemies love they kids
I’ma let my lil homeboys ride on you busta muthafuckers
cause y’all dont feel me

I don’t even wanna talk no more
losing your life, what for?
facing a young muthafucker who puts it down for the dough
get killed in front of your kids
God forbid if it happens
that’s the shit I’m on now [?]
gotta survive by myself
but at the same time they rappin’
wont put my gun on the shelf,
it keeps me living like heaven
but when the shit jumps I’m ready
cause I already knew
you better get this muthafucker before we come get you
deep in my heart I think this shits bout to pop any moment
tryna do me like my parents but I’m a tougher opponent

This nigga scared
Must investigate all I’m prepared
for all the drama, you said
for all them niggas you feared
you fucking busta, busta
Let the evil or the money trap you and thats life at you
every second we coming at you
and you the last one
When L-rock is trying cast on ya
Cuz a Young Rida who would die,
pump up and blast on the thug past you
Blastin on enemies passing
giggling when they should have been figuring who would be the last one, laughing while I switch your wig
I gotta ask ya’ll something
don’t you muthafuckers got kids
